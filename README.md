# Book Discounts Refactoring Kata

This code is part of the software system of our book store. The current code
deals with adding different goodies when delivering - e.g. discounts, promotions 
or gifts - to orders of books.

## Your Task

This exercise is hard. It includes several classes which form a coupled hierarchy.
Maybe start exploring a simpler code base first, which only has one level of hierarchy.

## Motivation

We want an exercise for working with deep inheritance hierarchies. What need at least

* 4-5 levels of hierarchy
* mutation on some levels
* 1 method calling some superclass methods
* override of some superclass methods in subclasses
